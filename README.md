# Binary Trees Learning Project

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- **What is a binary tree**
- **What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree**
- **What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists**
- **What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree**
- **What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree**
- **What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree**
```
### Data Structures
Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Donâ€™t forget to include them in your header file.

#### Basic Binary Tree
```c
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
### Binary Search Trees
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
AVL Tree
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```
max binary heap
```c
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
